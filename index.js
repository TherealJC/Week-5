// as you can see, normally it would count up indefinitely, but the use of 'break' stops this from happening
//In JavaScript, a statement can be labeled when a label_name: is prepended to a statement.
//Because a for loop is a statement you can label for loops. Letâ€™s try to increment value of c inside the inner loop.
//By choosing whether to break the loop and jump to the inner or mark label, we change the pattern in which the for loops will work:
// let c = 0;
// for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
// for (let c = 0; c < 5; c++)  {
//         c++; if (i == 2) break;
// console.log(c);
// }
//Website example that doesn't work, i have tried playing around with it, but it doesnt work
// the 'mark' command errors with "Undefined label 'mark'" and removing mark leaves me with 
//the error of illegal break statement 'break'
